This is whats wrong!
I mean, this is whats wrong. He buys and sells politicians of all stripes, hes already
Hey, look, look! Hes already hedging his bet on the Clintons, OK? So if he doesnt run as a Republican, maybe he supports Clinton, or maybe he runs as an independent but Id say that hes already hedging his bets because hes used to buying politicians.
First of all, only ISIS is responsible for the terrorism. Only ISIS is responsible for the depravity. But, we do have to examine, how are we going to defeat ISIS? Ive got a proposal. Im the leading voice in America for not arming the allies of ISIS. (APPLAUSE)
Ive been fighting amidst a lot of opposition from both Hillary Clinton, as well as some Republicans who wanted to send arms to the allies of ISIS. ISIS rides around in a billion dollars worth of U.S. Humvees. Its a disgrace. Weve got to stop  we shouldnt fund our enemies, for goodness sakes.
So, we didnt create ISIS  ISIS created themselves, but we will stop them, and one of the ways we stop them is by not funding them, and not arming them. (APPLAUSE)
Megyn, may I respond? (APPLAUSE)
May I respond?
I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from innocent Americans. The Fourth Amendment was what we fought the Revolution over! John Adams said it was the spark that led to our war for independence, and Im proud of standing for the Bill of Rights, and I will continue to stand for the Bill of Rights. (APPLAUSE)
Use the Fourth Amendment!
Use the Fourth Amendment!
Get a warrant!
Get a judge to sign the warrant!
See, heres the problem.
Heres the problem, governor. Heres the problem, governor. You fundamentally misunderstand the Bill of Rights. Every time you did a case, you got a warrant from a judge. Im talking about searches without warrants indiscriminately, of all Americans records, and thats what I fought to end. I dont trust President Obama with our records. I know you gave him a big hug, and if you want to give him a big hug again, go right ahead. (APPLAUSE)
Ive got a news flash
News flash, the Republican Partys been fighting against a single-payer system  for a decade. So I think youre on the wrong side of this if youre still arguing for a single-payer system.
I oppose the Iranian deal, and will vote against it. I dont think that the president negotiated from a position of strength, but I dont immediately discount negotiations. Im a Reagan conservative. Reagan did negotiate with the Soviets. But you have to negotiate from a position of strength, and I think President Obama gave away too much, too early. If theres going to be a negotiation, youre going to have to believe somehow that the Iranians are going to comply. I asked this question to John Kerry, I said do you believe theyre trustworthy? and he said No. And I said, well, how are we gonna get them to comply? I would have never released the sanctions before there was consistent evidence of compliance.
Look, I dont want my marriage or my guns registered in Washington. And if people have an opinion, its a religious opinion that is heartly felt, obviously they should be allowed to practice that and no government should interfere with them. One of the things, one of the things that really got to me was the thing in Houston where you had the government, the mayor actually, trying to get the sermons of ministers. When the government tries to invade the church to enforce its own opinion on marriage, thats when its time to resist.
Well, lets be clear, Im the only one on the stage who actually has a five-year budget that balances. Ive put pencil to paper  and Ive said  and Ive said I would cut spending, and Ive said exactly where. Each one of my budgets has taken a meat axe to foreign aid, because I think we ought to quit sending it to countries that hate us. (APPLAUSE) I think we ought to quit sending it to countries that burn our flag. Israel is not one of those. But even Benjamin Netanyahu said that ultimately, they will be stronger when theyre independent. My position is exactly the same. We shouldnt borrow money from China to send it anywhere, but why dont we start with eliminating aid to our enemies.
I still say exactly what my original opinion is. Do you borrow money from China to send it to anyone? Out of your surplus, you can help your allies, and Israel is a great ally. And this is no particular animus of Israel, but what I will say, and I will say over and over again, we cannot give away money we dont have. We do not project power from bankruptcy court. Were borrowing a million dollars a minute. (APPLAUSE) Its got to stop somewhere.
Im a different kind of Republican. Ive introduced a five-year balanced budget. Ive introduced the largest tax cut in our history. I stood for ten and a half hours on the Senate floor to defend your right to be left alone. (APPLAUSE)
But Ive also gone to Chicago. Ive gone to Detroit. Ive been to Ferguson, Ive been to Baltimore, because I want our party to be bigger, better and bolder, and Im the only one that leads Hillary Clinton in five states that were won by President Obama. Im a different kind of Republican. (APPLAUSE)
