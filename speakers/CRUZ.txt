Chris, I believe the American people are looking for someone to speak the truth. (APPLAUSE) If youre looking for someone to go to Washington, to go along to get along, to get  to agree with the career politicians in both parties who get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests, then I aint your guy. There is a reason (APPLAUSE) . that we have $18 trillion in debt. Because as conservatives, as Republicans, we keep winning elections. We got a Republican House, weve got a Republican Senate, and we dont have leaders who honor their commitments. I will always tell the truth and do what I said I would do. (APPLAUSE)
Chris, absolutely yes. And not only will I support it (APPLAUSE)  I have authored Kates law in the United States Senate and filed that legislation. I tried to get the Senate to vote to pass Kates law on the floor of the Senate just one week ago, and the leader of our own party blocked a vote on Kates law. You know, there was reference made to our leaders being stupid. Its not a question of stupidity. Its that they dont want to enforce the immigration laws. That there are far too many in the Washington cartel that support amnesty.
President Obama has talked about fundamentally transforming this country. Theres 7 billion people across the face of the globe, many of whom want to come to this country. If they come legally, great. But if they come illegally and they get amnesty, that is how we fundamentally change this country, and it really is striking. A majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty. I have never supported amnesty, and I led the fight against Chuck Schumers gang of eight amnesty legislation in the Senate.
Megyn, we need a commander in chief that speaks the truth. We will not defeat radical Islamic terrorism so long as we have a president unwilling to utter the words, radical Islamic terrorism. (APPLAUSE) When I asked General Dempsey, the chairman of the joint chiefs, what would be required militarily to destroy ISIS, he said there is no military solution. We need to change the conditions on the ground so that young men are not in poverty and susceptible to radicalization. That, with all due respect, is nonsense. Its the same answer the State Department gave that we need to give them jobs. What we need is a commander in chief that makes  clear, if you join ISIS, if you wage jihad on America, then you are signing your death warrant.
Megyn, of course its an ideological problem, thats one of the reasons I introduce the Expatriate Terrorist Act in the Senate that said if any American travels to the Middle East and joining ISIS, that he or she forfeits their citizenship so they dont use a passport to come back and wage jihad on Americans. (APPLAUSE)
Yes, it is ideological, and let me contrast President Obama, who at the prayer breakfast, essentially acted as an apologist. He said, Well, gosh, the crusades, the inquisitions We need a president that shows the courage that Egypts President al-Sisi, a Muslim, when he called out the radical Islamic terrorists who are threatening the world. (APPLAUSE)
Well, Bret, of course they have, and over the last six and a half years weve seen the consequences of the Obama-Clinton foreign policy. Leading from behind is a disaster. We have abandoned and alienated our friends and allies, and our enemies are stronger. Radical Islam is on the rise, Irans on the verge of acquiring a nuclear weapon, China is waging cyber warfare against America, Russia  General Soleimani, you just mentioned, the Iranian general is the head of the al Quds forces. Hes directly responsible for the murder of over 500 American servicemen in Iraq, and part of this Iranian deal was lifting the international sanctions on General Soleimani. The day General Soleimani flew back from Moscow to Iran was the day we believed that Russia used cyber warfare against the joint chiefs. We need a new commander in chief that will stand up to our enemies, and that will have credibility (APPLAUSE)
It is worth emphasizing that Iran released our hostages in 1981 the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office. (APPLAUSE)
Brett, can I  Brett, can I jump in on this one?
Well, I am blessed to receive a word from God every day in receiving the scriptures and reading the scriptures. And God speaks through the Bible. (APPLAUSE)
Im the son of a pastor and evangelist and Ive described many times how my father, when I was a child, was an alcoholic. He was not a Christian. And my father left my mother and left me when I was just three years old. And someone invited him to Clay Road Baptist Church. And he gave his heart to Jesus and it turned him around. And he got on a plane and he flew back to my mother and me. (APPLAUSE)
I would also note that the scripture tells us, you shall know them by their fruit. We see lots of campaign conservatives. But if were going to win in 2016, we need a consistent conservative, someone who has been a fiscal conservative, a social conservative, a national security conservative. There are real differences among the candidates on issues like amnesty, like Obamacare, like religious liberty, like life and marriage. And I have been proud to fight and stand for religious liberty, to stand against Planned Parenthood, to defend life for my entire career. And I will be proud to continue to do so as president of the United States. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
If Im elected president, let me tell you about my first day in office. The first thing I intend to do is to rescind every illegal and unconstitutional executive action taken by Barack Obama. (APPLAUSE)
The next thing I intend to do is instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into these videos and to prosecute Planned Parenthood for any criminal violations. (APPLAUSE)
The next thing I intend to do is instruct the Department of Justice and the IRS to start (sic) persecuting religious liberty, and then intend to cancel the Iran deal, and finally move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. c (APPLAUSE) I will keep my word. My father fled Cuba, and I will fight to defend liberty because my family knows what its like to lose it.
