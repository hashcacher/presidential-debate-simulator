Well, Im pro-life, Ive always been pro-life, and Ive got a position that I think is consistent with many Americans out there in that (APPLAUSE) in that I believe that that is an unborn child thats in need of protection out there, and Ive said many a time that that unborn child can be protected, and there are many other alternatives that can also protect the life of that mother. Thats been consistently proven. Unlike Hillary Clinton, who has a radical position in terms of support for Planned Parenthood, I defunded Planned Parenthood more than four years ago, long before any of these videos came out (APPLAUSE) Ive got a position thats in line with everyday America. (APPLAUSE)
Chris, I actually said that on your show earlier this year. (CROSSTALK)
I acknowledged that. I said I actually listened to the American people. And I think people across America want a leader whos actually going to listen to them. I talked to border state governors and other elected officials. I look at how this president, particularly through last November, messed up the immigration system in this country. Most importantly, I listened to the people of America. I believe we need to secure the border. Ive been to the border with Governor Abbott in Texas and others, seeing the problems that they have there. There is international criminal organizations penetrating our southern based borders, and we need to do something about it. Secure the border, enforce the law, no amnesty, and go forward with the legal immigration system that gives priority to American working families and wages. (APPLAUSE)
What about then (ph), we need to focus on the ones we have. You look at Egypt, probably the best relationship weve had in Israel, at least in my lifetime, incredibly important. You look at the Saudis  in fact, earlier this year, I met with Saudi leaders, and leaders from the United Arab Emirates, and I asked them whats the greatest challenge in the world today? Set aside the Iran deal. They said its the disengagement of America. We are leading from behind under the Obama-Clinton doctrine  Americas a great country. We need to stand up and start leading again, and we need to have allies, not just in Israel, but throughout the Persian Gulf.
Just one second on this, though. We  we spent a lot of time talking about Hillary Clinton and and pitting us back and forth. Lets be clear, we should be talking about Hillary Clinton on that last subject, because everywhere in the world that Hillary Clinton touched is more messed up today than before she and the president (INAUDIBLE).
Its true.
Well, the voters in Wisconsin elected me last year for the third time because they wanted someone who aimed high, not aimed low. Before I came in, the unemployment rate was over eight percent. Its now down to 4.6 percent. Weve more than made up for the jobs that were lost during the recession. And the rate in which people are working is almost five points higher than it is nationally. You know, people like Hillary Clinton think you grow the economy by growing Washington. One report last year showed that six of the top 10 wealthiest counties in America were in or around Washington, D.C.. I think most of us in America understand that people, not the government creates jobs. And one of the best things we can do is get the government out of the way, repeal Obamacare, put in  reign in all the out of control regulations, put in place and all of the above energy policy, give people the education, the skills that the need to succeed, and lower the tax rate and reform the tax code. Thats what Ill do as president, just like I did in Wisconsin. (APPLAUSE)
Well, first off, lets remember. I still remember, as a kid, tying a yellow ribbon around a tree in front of my house during the 444 days that Iran held 52 Americans hostage. Iran is not a place we should be doing business with. To me, you terminate the deal on day one, you reinstate the sanctions authorized by Congress, you go to Congress and put in place even more crippling sanctions in place, and then you convince our allies to do the same. This is not just bad with Iran, this is bad with ISIS. It is tied together, and, once and for all, we need a leader whos gonna stand up and do something about it. Its yet another example of the failed foreign policy of the Obama-Clinton doctrine. (APPLAUSE)
Well, I think the most important thing we can do when it comes to policing  its something youve had a guest on whos a friend of mine Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clark, whos talked to me about this many times in the past  its about training. Its about making sure that law enforcement professionals, not only in the way in to their positions but all the way through their time, have the proper training, particularly when it comes to the use of force. And that we protect and stand up and support those men and women who are doing their jobs in law enforcement. And for the very few that dont, that there are consequences to show that we treat everyone the same here in America.
Well first off, for the cyber attack with Russia the other day, its sad to think right now, but probably the Russian and Chinese government know more about Hillary Clintons e-mail server than do the members of the United States Congress. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) And  and that has put our national security at risk. If I am president, he wont think about that. You know, Putin believes in the old Lenin adage: you probe with bayonets. When you find mush, you push. When you find steel, you stop. Under Obama and Clinton, we found a lot of mush over the last two years. We need to have a national security that puts steel in front of our enemies. I would send weapons to Ukraine. I would work with NATO to put forces on the eastern border of Poland and the Baltic nations, and I would reinstate, put in place back in the missile defense system that we had in Poland and in the Czech Republic. (APPLAUSE) We define (ph) steel.
Well, thanks, Megyn. Im certainly an imperfect man. And its only by the blood of Jesus Christ that Ive been redeemed from my sins. So I know that God doesnt call me to do a specific thing, God hasnt given me a list, a Ten Commandments, if you will, of things to act on the first day. What God calls us to do is follow his will. And ultimately thats what Im going to try to do. And I hope people see it in my state, even in the big challenges I took on when I had over 100,000 protesters in and around our capital, trying to do what I thought was the right thing. It wasnt just how I took on those political battles. It was ultimately how I acted. Not responding in kind. Not lashing out. But just being decent going forward and living my life in a way that would be a testimony to him and our faith. (APPLAUSE)
Thanks. Im guy with a wife and two kids, and Harley. One article called me aggressively normal. I ran for governor because I was worried about my kids future. Then, I took on the big government union bosses, and we won. They tried to recall me, and we won. They target us again, and we won. We balanced the budget, cut taxes, and turned our state around with big, bold reforms. It wasnt too late for Wisconsin, and its not too late for America. Thats why I ask for your vote.
