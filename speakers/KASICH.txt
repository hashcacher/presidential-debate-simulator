Well, first of all (APPLAUSE)  first of all, Megyn, you should know that  that President Reagan expanded Medicaid three or four times. Secondly, I had an opportunity to bring resources back to Ohio to do what? To treat the mentally ill. Ten thousand of them sit in our prisons. It costs $22,500 a year (APPLAUSE)  to keep them in prison. Id rather get them their medication so they could lead a decent life. Secondly, we are rehabbing the drug-addicted. Eighty percent of the people in our prisons have addictions or problems. We now treat them in the prisons, release them in the community and the recidivism rate is 10 percent and everybody across this country knows that the tsunami of drugs is  is threatening their very families. So were treating them and getting them on their feet. And, finally, the working poor, instead of them having come into the emergency rooms where it costs more, where theyre sicker and we end up paying, we brought a program in here to make sure that people could get on their feet. And do you know what? Everybody has a right to their God-given purpose. And finally, our Medicaid is growing at one of the lowest rates in the country. And, finally, we went from $8 billion in the hole to $2 billion in the black. Weve cut $5 billion in taxes (BUZZER NOISE)  and weve grown 350,000 jobs. (APPLAUSE)
Chris, first of all, I was just saying to Chris Christie, they say were outspoken, we need to take lessons from Donald Trump if were really going to learn it. Here is the thing about Donald Trump. Donald Trump is hitting a nerve in this country. He is. Hes hitting a nerve. People are frustrated. Theyre fed up. They dont think the government is working for them. And for people who want to just tune him out, theyre making a mistake. Now, hes got his solutions. Some of us have other solutions. You know, look, I balanced the federal budget as one of the chief architects when I was in Washington. Hasnt been done since. I was a military reformer. I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole and a 350,000 job loss to a $2 billion surplus and a gain of 350,000 jobs.
But the point is that we all have solutions. Mr. Trump is touching a nerve because people want the wall to be built. They want to see an end to illegal immigration. They want to see it, and we all do. But we all have different ways of getting there. And youre going to hear from all of us tonight about what our ideas are.
Lets start off with my father being a mailman. So I understand the concerns of all the folks across this country, some of whom having trouble, you know, making ends meet. But I think she will come in a narrow way. The nominee of this party, if theyre going to win, has got to come at it in a big way, which is pro-growth. Which is balancing budgets. You know, we were talking about it. People were saying, could we do it? I was the chairman of the Budget Committee and the lead architect the last time it happened in Washington, and when we did it we had great economic growth, we cut taxes, and we had a big surplus. Economic growth is the key. Economic growth is the key to everything. But once you have economic growth, it is important that we reach out to people who live in the shadows, the people who dont seem to ever think that they get a fair deal. And that includes people in our minority community; that includes people who feel as though they dont have a chance to move up. You know, America is a miracle country. And we have to restore the sense that the Amiracle (ph) will apply to you. Each and every one of the people in this country whos watching tonight, lift everybody, unite everybody and build a stronger United States of America again. It will be and can be done.
Well, look, Im an old-fashioned person here, and I happen to believe in traditional marriage. But Ive also said the court has ruled 
Wait, Megyn, the court has ruled, and I said well accept it. And guess what, I just went to a wedding of a friend of mine who happens to be gay. Because somebody doesnt think the way I do, doesnt mean that I cant care about them or cant love them. So if one of my daughters happened to be that, of course I would love them and I would accept them. Because you know what? (APPLAUSE)
Thats what were taught when we have strong faith. (APPLAUSE)
So the issues like that, issues like that are planted to divide us. I think the simple fact of the matter is, and this is where I would agree with Jeb, and Ive been saying it all along, we need to give everybody a chance, treat everybody with respect, and let them share in this great American dream that we have, Megan. So, look, Im going to love my daughters, Im going to love them no matter what they do. Because, you know what, God gives me unconditional love. Im going to give it to my family and my friends and the people around me.
Well, Megyn, my father was a mailman. His father was a coal miner. My mothers mother could barely speak English. And their son today stands on this podium in the great state of Ohio not only as the governor, but a candidate for president of the United States. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
I do believe in miracles. You know, Ive had a lot of elections. But my elections are really not about campaigns. I tell my people that these are about a movement. And a movement to do what? To restore common sense. A movement to do things like provide economic growth. And a movement not to let anybody be behind. You know, today the country is divided. You asked a question about the police and the difficulty in communities. Weve got to unite our country again, because were stronger when we are united and we are weaker when we are divided. And weve got to listen to other peoples voices, respect them, but keep in mind, and I believe in terms of the things that Ive read in my lifetime, the lord is not picking us. But because of how we respect human rights, because that we are a good force in the world, he wants America to be strong. He wants America to succeed. And he wants America to lead. And nothing is more important to me than my family, my faith, and my friends. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
You know, tonight we hear about what people want to do. I want to tell you what Ive done. I was a member of the Armed Services Committee for 18 years. I spent a big chunk of my life studying national security issues and our role in the world. No. 2. I was the chairman of the House Budget Committee and one of the chief architects the last time we balanced a budget, and it was the first time we had done it since man walked on the moon. We had a $5 trillion surplus and we cut taxes. I spent ten years in the private sector, actually learning how business works. And now Im the governor of Ohio, and I inherited a state that was on the brink of dying. And we turned it all around with jobs and balanced budgets and rising credit and tax cuts, and the state is unified, and people have hope again in Ohio. (APPLAUSE)
