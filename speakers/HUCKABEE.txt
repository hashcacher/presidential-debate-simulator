Chris, I disagree with the idea that the real issue is a constitutional amendment. Thats a long and difficult process. Ive actually taken the position thats bolder than that. A lot of people are talking about defunding planned parenthood, as if thats a huge game changer. I think its time to do something even more bold. I think the next president ought to invoke the Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the constitution now that we clearly know that that baby inside the mothers womb is a person at the moment of conception. The reason we know that it is is because of the DNA schedule that we now have clear scientific evidence on. And, this notion that we just continue to ignore the personhood of the individual is a violation of that unborn childs Fifth and 14th Amendment rights for due process and equal protection under the law. Its time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the supreme being, and we change the policy to be pro-life and protect children instead of rip up their body parts and sell them like theyre parts to a Buick. (APPLAUSE)
Its not too big to shrink. But the problem is we have a Wall Street-to-Washington access of power that has controlled the political climate. The donor class feeds the political class who does the dance that the donor class wants. And the result is federal government keeps getting bigger. Every person on this stage who has been a governor will tell that you the biggest fight they had was not the other party. Wasnt even the legislature. It was the federal government, who continually put mandates on the states that we had to suck up and pay for. And the fact is there are a lot of things happening at the federal level that are absolutely beyond the jurisdiction of the Constitution. This is power that should be shifted back to the states, whether its the EPA, there is no role at the federal level for the Department of Education. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
And Im still one who says that we can get rid of the Internal Revenue Service if we would pass the fair tax, which is a tax on consumption rather than a tax on peoples income, and move power back where the founders believed it should have been all along.
Well, lets all be reminded, 60 million Americans are on Social Security, 60 million. A third of those people depend on 90% of their income from Social Security. Nobody in this country is on Social Security because they made the decision when they were starting work at 14 that they wanted to trust some of their money with the government. The government took it out of their check whether they wanted them to or not. And, if person goes to 65, theyre going to spend 51 years with the government reaching into their pocket at every paycheck. Now, heres the point, whose fault is it that the system is screwed up? Is it the recipients, or is it the government? And, if Congress wants to mess with the retirement program, why dont we let them start by changing their retirement program, and not have one, instead of talking about getting rid of Social Security and Medicare that was robbed $700 billion dollars to pay for Obamacare. Its always that the government figures that they can do this off the backs of people, many of whom are poor, and depend on that money, and I just think its fundamentally lying to people and stealing from them, and we shouldnt be doing it. (APPLAUSE)
Well, you ask about how we fund it. One of the reasons that Social Security is in so much trouble is that the only funding stream comes from people who get a wage. The people who get wages is declining dramatically. Most of the income in this country is made by people at the top who get dividends and  and capital gains.
The fair (ph) transforms the process by which we fund Social Security and Medicare because the money paid in consumption is paid by everybody, including illegals, prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers, all the people that are freeloading off the system now. (APPLAUSE) Thats why it ought to be a transformed system. (APPLAUSE)
Ronald Reagan said trust, but verify. President Obama is trust, but vilify. He trusts our enemies and vilifies everyone who disagrees with him. And the reason we disagree with him has nothing ot do with party. (APPLAUSE) (CROSSTALK)
It has to do with the incredibly dangerous place that this world is gonna be as a result of a deal in which we got nothing. We didnt even get four hostages out. We got nothing, and Iran gets everything they want. We said we would have anywhere, anytime negotiations and inspections, we gave that up. We said that we would make sure that they didnt have any nuclear capacity, we gave that up. The president cant tell you what we got. Ill tell you what the world got. The world has a burgeoning nuclear power that didnt, as the Soviets, say we might defend ourselves in a war. What the Iranians have said is, we will wipe Israel off the face of the map, and we will bring death to America. When someone points a gun at your head and loads it, by God, you ought to take them seriously, and we need to take that seriously.
The military is not a social experiment. The purpose of the military is kill people and break things. (APPLAUSE) Its not to transform the culture by trying out some ideas that some people think would make us a different country and more diverse. The purpose is to protect America. Im not sure how paying for transgender surgery for soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines makes our country safer. Weve reduced the military by 25 percent (APPLAUSE)  under President Obama. The disaster is that weve forgotten why we have a military. The purpose of it is to make sure that we protect every American, wherever that American is, and if an American is calling out for help, whether its in Benghazi or at the border, then we ought to be able to answer it. Weve not done that because weve decimated our military. Were flying B-52s. The most recent one that was put in service was November of 1962. A lot of the B-52s were flying, weve only got 44 that are in service combat ready, and the fact is, most of them are older than me. And thats pretty scary. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)
It seems like this election has been a whole lot about a person whos very high in the polls, that doesnt have a clue about how to govern. A person who has been filled with scandals, and who could not lead, and, of course, Im talking about Hillary Clinton. (LAUGHTER) I think America is in trouble, but its not beyond repair. But its going to take leadership who sees the greatness of this country, and who believes that once again we can be one nation, under God. Ill be my best to do that, and thank you for your support. (APPLAUSE)
