Well, I could take issue with  with all of those things, but we dont have time. But I will say, we have a debate here tonight, and we will have an opportunity to explore those areas, and Im looking very much forward to demonstrating that, in fact, the thing that is probably most important is having a brain, and to be able to figure things out and learn things very rapidly. So, you know, experience comes from a large number of different arenas, and America became a great nation early on not because it was flooded with politicians, but because it was flooded with people who understood the value of personal responsibility, hard work, creativity, innovation, and thats what will get us on the right track now, as well.
Well, thank you, Megyn, I wasnt sure I was going to get to talk again. (APPLAUSE)
Alright. You know, what we do in order to get the information that we need is our business, and I wouldnt necessarily be broadcasting what were going to do. (APPLAUSE)
Weve gotten into this  this mindset of fighting politically correct wars. There is no such thing as a politically correct war. (APPLAUSE)
The left, of course, will say Carson doesnt believe in the Geneva Convention, Carson doesnt believe in fighting stupid wars. And  and what we have to remember is we want to utilize the tremendous intellect that we have in the military to win wars. And Ive talked to a lot of the generals, a lot of our advanced people. And believe me, if we gave them the mission, which is what the commander-in-chief does, they would be able to carry it out. And if we dont tie their hands behind their back, they will do it (BUZZER NOISE)  extremely effectively. (APPLAUSE)
What I agree with is that we need a significantly changed taxation system. And the one that Ive advocated is based on tithing, because I think God is a pretty fair guy. And he said, you know, if you give me a tithe, it doesnt matter how much you make. If youve had a bumper crop, you dont owe me triple tithes. And if youve had no crops at all, you dont owe me no tithes. So there must be something inherently fair about that. And thats why Ive advocated a proportional tax system. You make $10 billion, you pay a billion. You make $10, you pay one. And everybody gets treated the same way. And you get rid of the deductions, you get rid of all the loopholes, and (DOUBLE BELL RINGS)
And I have a lot more to say about it.
If Hillary is the candidate, which I doubt, that would be a dream come true. (LAUGHTER) But you know, the fact of the matter is, she is the epitome of the progressive  the secular progressive movement. And she counts on the fact that people are uninformed, the Alinsky Model, taking advantage of useful idiots. Well, I just happen to believe that people are not stupid. (APPLAUSE) And the way I will come at it is to educate people, help people to actually understand that it is that progressive movement that is causing them the problems. You know, you look at the  the national debt and how its being driven up. If I was trying to destroy this country, what I would do is find a way to drive wedges between all the people, drive the debt to an unsustainable level, and then step off the stage as a world leader and let our enemies increase while we decreased our capacity as a military person. And thats what shes doing. (APPLAUSE)
Well, what we have to stop and think about is that we have weakened ourselves militarily to such an extent that if affects all of our military policies. Our Navy is at its smallest size since 1917; our Air Force, since 1940. In recent testimony, the commandant of the Marine Corps said half of the non-deployed units were not ready and you know, the sequester is cutting the heart out of our personnel. Our generals are retiring because they dont want to be part of this, and at the same time, our enemies are increasing. Our  our friends cant trust us anymore. You know, Ukraine was a nuclear-armed state. They gave away their nuclear arms with the understanding that we would protect them. We wont even give them offensive weapons. You know, we turned our back on Israel, our ally. You know, and a situation like that, of course Obamas not going to be able to do anything. I would shore up our military first, because if you dont get the military right, nothing else is going to work. (APPLAUSE)
Well, I think the bully pulpit is a wonderful place to start healing that divide. You know, we have the purveyors of hatred who take every single incident between people of two races and try to make a race war out of it, and drive wedges into people. And this does not need to be done. What we need to think about instead  you know, I was asked by an NPR reporter once, why dont I talk about race that often. I said its because Im a neurosurgeon. And she thought that was a strange response. And you say  I said, you see, when I take someone to the operating room, Im actually operating on the thing that makes them who they are. The skin doesnt make them who they are. The hair doesnt make them who they are. And its time for us to move beyond that. (APPLAUSE)
Because  (APPLAUSE)  our strength as a nation comes in our unity. We are the United States of America, not the divided states. And those who want to divide us are trying to divide us, and we shouldnt let them do it. (APPLAUSE)
Well, I havent said anything about me being the only one to do anything, so let me try that. Im the only one to separate siamese twins (LAUGHTER) The  the only one to operate on babies while they were still in mothers womb, the only one to take out half of a brain, although you would think, if you go to Washington, that someone had beat me to it. (LAUGHTER) But I  but Im very hopeful that Im not the only onel whos willing to pick up the baton of freedom, because freedom is not free, and we must fight for it every day. Every one of us must fight for it, because were fighting for our children and the next generation. (APPLAUSE)
